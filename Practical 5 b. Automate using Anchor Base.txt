b. Automate using Anchor Base 
This control is used for locating the UI element by looking at the UI element next to it. This 
activity is used when we have no control over the selector. That means when we do not have 
a reliable selector, then we should use the Anchor base control to locate the UI element. 
We can use the Anchor base control as explained in the following section:  
1. Drag and drop a Flowchart activity on the Designer panel of a blank project. Also, drag and 
drop an Anchor base control from the Activities panel. Connect the Anchor base control with 
Start.  
2. Double-click on the Anchor base control:    
3. There are two activities that we have to supply to the Anchor base control: Anchor and 
action activities.  
4. Drag and drop the Anchor base activity (for example; Find Element activity) in the Anchor 
field and Action activity (for example; Type into) in the Drop Action Activity Here field of 
the Anchor base control.  
The Anchor base activity will find the relative element nearby the element on which you want 
to perform the Action, and the Action activity will perform the appropriate action that you 
have specified
