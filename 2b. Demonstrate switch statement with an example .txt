activity is very useful in   the categorization of data according to one's own choice. 
Perform the following steps:  
1. Add a Sequence activity.  
2. Add an Input dialog activity inside the Sequence. 
3. Now, create an integer type variable L. 
4. Specify the newly created variable's name in the Result property inside the Properties 
panel. 
5. Add the Switch activity under the Input dialog activity.  
6. In the Expression field, set LNPE to check whether the number is divisible by 2 or not.  
7. Add a Write line activity to the Default section and type the L5P4USJOH  JTBOFWFOOVNCFS
 in the text field. 
8. Now, create Case 1, add the one other Write line activity to it, and type L5P4USJOH 
JTBOPEEOVNCFS
 in the text field:
