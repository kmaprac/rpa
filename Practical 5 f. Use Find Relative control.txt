Step 1: Open UiPath Studio and Create a New Project
Action: Launch UiPath Studio and create a new project (e.g., "FindRelativeDemo").
Purpose: To set up a workspace for implementing the Find Relative activity.

Step 2: Drag and Drop a Sequence Activity
Action: From the Activities panel, drag a Sequence activity onto the main workflow.
Purpose: To organize the activities that will be performed in this practical.

Step 3: Add the Find Relative Activity
Action: Search for the Find Relative activity in the Activities panel.
Drag and Drop: Drag the Find Relative activity into the Sequence.
Purpose: This activity will allow you to find a UI element relative to another specified element.

Step 4: Indicate the Base Element
Action: Click on the "Indicate Element" button in the Find Relative activity.
Select Base Element: Navigate to the application or webpage where the base element is located (e.g., a label or a parent container).
Purpose: This step allows UiPath to capture the specific base UI element from which you want to find the relative element.

Step 5: Configure the Find Relative Activity
Action: In the Properties panel of the Find Relative activity, configure the following:
Output: Create a variable to store the found relative element.
Variable Name: relativeElement
Variable Type: UiElement
Set Relative Position: Specify the relative position to find the target element (e.g., Above, Below, Left, Right).
Purpose: This variable will hold the UI element that is found relative to the specified base element.

Step 6: Use the Relative Element
Action: After the Find Relative activity, you can perform actions using the relativeElement.
Example Action: Drag a Click activity into the Sequence below the Find Relative activity.
Indicate Element: In the Click activity, set the Element property to relativeElement.
Purpose: This action will click on the relative element that was retrieved.

Step 7: Add a Message Box to Confirm the Action
Action: After the Click activity, drag a Message Box activity into the Sequence.
Configure Message Box:
Text: Set the text to "Clicked on the relative element."
Purpose: This message box will confirm that the action was performed successfully.

Step 8: Run the Workflow
Action: Click the "Run" button in UiPath Studio to execute the workflow.
Expected Outcome: The automation will retrieve the relative element based on the specified base element and perform a click action on it, followed by displaying a confirmation message.
