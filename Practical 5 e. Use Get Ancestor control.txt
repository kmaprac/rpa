Step 1: Open UiPath Studio and Create a New Project
Action: Launch UiPath Studio and create a new project (e.g., "GetAncestorDemo").
Purpose: To set up a workspace for implementing the Get Ancestor activity.

Step 2: Drag and Drop a Sequence Activity
Action: From the Activities panel, drag a Sequence activity onto the main workflow.
Purpose: To organize the activities that will be performed in this practical.

Step 3: Add the Get Ancestor Activity
Action: Search for the Get Ancestor activity in the Activities panel.
Drag and Drop: Drag the Get Ancestor activity into the Sequence.
Purpose: This activity will retrieve the ancestor of a specified UI element.

Step 4: Indicate the Child Element
Action: Click on the "Indicate Element" button in the Get Ancestor activity.
Select Child Element: Navigate to the application or webpage where the child element is located (e.g., a button or text field).
Purpose: This step allows UiPath to capture the specific child UI element for which you want to find the ancestor.

Step 5: Configure the Get Ancestor Activity
Action: In the Properties panel of the Get Ancestor activity, configure the following:
Output: Create a variable to store the ancestor element.
Variable Name: ancestorElement
Variable Type: UiElement
Purpose: This variable will hold the ancestor UI element retrieved from the specified child element.

Step 6: Use the Ancestor Element
Action: After the Get Ancestor activity, you can perform actions using the ancestorElement.
Example Action: Drag a Click activity into the Sequence below the Get Ancestor activity.
Indicate Element: In the Click activity, set the Element property to ancestorElement.
Purpose: This action will click on the ancestor element that was retrieved.

Step 7: Add a Message Box to Confirm the Action
Action: After the Click activity, drag a Message Box activity into the Sequence.
Configure Message Box:
Text: Set the text to "Clicked on the ancestor element."
Purpose: This message box will confirm that the action was performed successfully.

Step 8: Run the Workflow
Action: Click the "Run" button in UiPath Studio to execute the workflow.
Expected Outcome: The automation will retrieve the ancestor of the specified child element and perform a click action on it, followed by displaying a confirmation message.
