e. Create an automation using Delay Activity between two writeline 
activities to separate their execution by 5 seconds 
To better understand how the Delay activity works, let us see an example of an automation 
that writes two messages to the Output panel with a delay of 50 seconds. 
Perform the following steps:  
1. First, create a new Flowchart.  
2. Add a Write line activity from the Activities panel and connect it to the Start node. 
3. Select the Write line activity. Now, type the following text into the Text box:  
“Hey, what is your name?” 
4. Next, add a Delay activity and connect it to the Write line activity.  
5. Select the Delay activity and go to the Properties panel. In the Duration field, set 00:00:50. 
This is a 50-second delay between the two logged messages.  
6. Take another Write line activity and connect it to the Delay activity. In the Text field, write 
“My name is Andrew Ng”: 
7. After clicking on the Run button, the Output panel shows the message that delays it by 50 
seconds:
