c. Automate the process of launching an assistant bot on a keyboard 
event. 
Let us say we want our assistant bot to start automating only when we trigger an event. For 
example, the user wants his Robot to open and start typing in the Notepad window when he 
presses Alt + W. This can be achieved using the Hotkey trigger. Also, inside the Event 
handler, just create or record the sequence of steps to be followed. The detailed procedure has 
been explained in the following sections:  
1. Drag and drop the Monitor events activity: In this step, we will just drag and drop the 
Monitor events activity into the workflow. When we double-click on it, it will look like this: 
2.Drag the Hotkey trigger activity: In the next step, we will use the Hotkey trigger activity for 
the user to start the automation process. Assign Alt + W to the hotkey so that, when the user 
presses this hotkey, the event will be executed:          
3.Open Notepad and type into it: Our final step is to record the sequence of the steps to be 
performed. In this case, this is to open Notepad and then type into it. For that just use the help 
of the Desktop recorder. First, we double-click on the Notepad application in the window as 
shown in the screenshot. Select the ClickType as CLICK_DOUBLE from the Properties 
panel: 
After that, we record the typing action and close the Notepad window. Then click on Do not 
Save because you do not want to save your file. The sequence is shown in the following 
screenshot: 
We have also indicated the anchor to recognize the correct button to be clicked (in this case, 
the close window button's anchor is the maximize button). This makes it easier for the Robot 
to find the UI element. 
Now, on pressing Alt + W the Robot will start executing the sequence.
