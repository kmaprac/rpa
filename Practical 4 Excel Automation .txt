Practical 4 : Excel Automation 


a. Automate the process to extract data from an excel file into a data 
table and vice versa 
Step:  
1.Start project with sequence.  
2. Add “Excel Application Scope” and enter the path of excel file 
3. Inside body add “Read Range” variable name and datatype as datatable(emp_data) and 
range to extract data from excel (blank means entire sheet) 
4. Add “Output Data Table” input as “emp_data” output as “emp_table”. 
5. “Message Box” to print the result adding variable “emp_table” (here extracted data will be 
printed). 
6. Insert “excel application scope” and new excel sheet path 
7. Insert “Write Range” range from where the data should be pasted and variable “emp_data”. 
8.Message Box to print confirmation. 
Output : 


b,c,d .  Create an application automating the read, write and append 
operation on excel file. 

b. Write cell:  
Step 1 : Drag and drop a flowchart activity.  
Step 2: Select activity “Build Data Table” and enter some data into it  
Step 3: Create a data table variable MyDataTable MyDataTable of DataTable type  
Step 4: Set the output of Build Data Table activity to MyDataTable 
Step 5: Select Excel Application Scope .Specify the path of the excel sheet  
Step 6: Select Write Range Activity.  
Step 7: Specify the sheet name and range of cells to write Step 8: Set the data table value to 
MyDataTable 
Step 9: Run 
Output:

c. Read cell:  
Step 1 : Drag and drop a flowchart activity.  
Step 2: Drag and drop read range activity.  
Step 3: Specify the path of excel sheet, sheet name as well as the range of cells to read. 
Value in excel: 
Step 4: Create a variable of type “string” to hold the read data.  
Step 5: Create a datatable variable “MyDataTable” of DataTable type. 
Step 6: Set the output of Read Range activity to MyDataTable 
Step 7: Drag and drop Output Data table activity  
Step 8: Select the Activity Output Data Table and set its input to “mydatatable” and output to 
“result” 
Step 9: Select Message Box activity and configure it to display the “Result” variable 
contents.  
Step 10: Run the file. 

 
d. Append range:  
Step 1 : Drag and drop a flowchart activity.  
Step 2: Select activity “Build Data Table” and enter some data into it  
Step 3: Create a data table variable MyDataTable MyDataTable of DataTable type  
Step 4: Set the output of Build Data Table activity to MyDataTable  
Step 5: Select Excel Application Scope .Specify the path of the excel sheet  
Step 6: Select Append Range Activity.  
Step 7: Specify the sheet name and range of cells to write  
Step 8: Set the data table value to MyDataTable 
 
Step 9: Run 
Output:
