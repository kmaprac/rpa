c. Automate using Element Exists. 

Step 1: Open UiPath Studio and Create a New Project
Action: Launch UiPath Studio and create a new project (e.g., "ElementExistsDemo").
Purpose: To set up a workspace for implementing the Element Exists activity.

Step 2: Drag and Drop a Sequence Activity
Action: From the Activities panel, drag a Sequence activity onto the main workflow.
Purpose: To organize the activities that will be performed in this practical.

Step 3: Add the Element Exists Activity
Action: Search for the Element Exists activity in the Activities panel.
Drag and Drop: Drag the Element Exists activity into the Sequence.
Purpose: This activity will check for the presence of a specified UI element.

Step 4: Indicate the UI Element
Action: Click on the "Indicate Element" button in the Element Exists activity.
Select Element: Navigate to the application or webpage where the element you want to check is located (e.g., a button, label, or text field).
Purpose: This step allows UiPath to capture the specific UI element you want to monitor.

Step 5: Create an Output Variable
Action: In the Properties panel of the Element Exists activity, find the Output property.
Create Variable: Click on the "Create Variable" button (or manually create a variable in the Variables panel).
Variable Name: elementExists
Variable Type: Boolean
Purpose: This variable will store the result of the Element Exists check (True if the element is found, False if not).

Step 6: Add Conditional Logic Using an If Activity
Action: Search for the If activity in the Activities panel and drag it below the Element Exists activity in the Sequence.
Purpose: The If activity will allow you to execute different actions based on whether the element exists.
Configure the If Activity:
Condition: Set the condition to elementExists (the Boolean variable created earlier).
Then Branch: This branch will execute if the element is found.
Else Branch: This branch will execute if the element is not found.

Step 7: Add Actions in the Then Branch
Action: Inside the Then branch of the If activity, drag a Message Box activity.
Configure Message Box:
Text: Set the text to "Element exists on the screen."
Purpose: This message will inform the user that the specified UI element was found.

Step 8: Add Actions in the Else Branch
Action: Inside the Else branch of the If activity, drag another Message Box activity.
Configure Message Box:
Text: Set the text to "Element does not exist on the screen."
Purpose: This message will inform the user that the specified UI element was not found.

Step 9: Run the Workflow
Action: Click the "Run" button in UiPath Studio to execute the workflow.
Expected Outcome:
If the specified UI element exists, a message box will display: "Element exists on the screen."
If the specified UI element does not exist, a message box will display: "Element does not exist on the screen."
